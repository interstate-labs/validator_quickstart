## Interstate

Interstate is a proposer commitment network that sits on top of Flashbots / MEV Boost. Please view docs.interstate.so/research for details on the protocol.

We are a sidecar that auctions off the transaction inclusion rights to users that seek to buy preconfirmations, and apps that seek to buy blockspace for blockspace futures.

Have an ethereum validator running and run our sidecar as well to begin earning rewards.

## EL/CL/VL nodes

Interstate is running on its private network at this moment. To run interstate sidecar, you need to spin up the EL/CL/VC nodes on your machine.
https://github.com/interstate-labs/interstate-testnet/tree/main/network-configs
This is the network-configs setup for the private network.

### Spin up nodes with eth-docker
You can spin up EL/CL/VC nodes with [eth-docker](https://github.com/interstate-labs/eth-docker).

#### Clone the eth-docker repo
Just clone the eth-docker with the following command.
```bash
https://github.com/interstate-labs/eth-docker
```
Inside the eth-docker folder, install the required apps.
```bash
./ethd install
```

#### Config the eth-docker
Use the following command to enter to the ethd config setup screen.
```bash
./ethd config
```
1. Select the **Custom Testnet** for **Select the Network** step.
2. Use the following network-configs for the following form.
https://github.com/interstate-labs/interstate-testnet/tree/main/network-configs.
3. Select **Ethereum Nodes** for the next step.
4. Select **Geth** and **lighthouse** for EL and CL node types.
5. Select other settings

#### Update environment setup to expose ports
Open the `.env` file generated b the above command.

You can use your favorite editor to open the file.

Then add `el-shared.yml`, and `el-shared.yml` to the COMPOSE field.

> example
```
COMPOSE_FILE=lighthouse.yml:geth.yml:el-shared.yml:cl-shared.yml
```

#### Spin up the nodes
Use the following command to spin up the nodes.
```bash
./ethd up
```

### Register Validators

#### Get test ETH for validator activation
32ETH is required for the validatior activation.


#### Clone the config repository for registering validators
Here's the github repository.
```
https://github.com/interstate-labs/new-validator-register 
```
You may need to ask the github access to this repo


#### Install tools for registration
- Install golang on your system
- Install **eth2-val-tools** and **ethereal** by using the following commands.
```
go install github.com/protolambda/eth2-val-tools@latest
go install github.com/wealdtech/ethereal/v2@latest
```


#### Generate and store mnemonics for validators and withdrawals
You can use the following command to generate mnemonics.
```
eth2-val-tools mnemonic
```

#### Create a **secrets.env** file

> TIP: You can use the following secret values for the current testnet.
```bash
# This will usually be 0
ACC_START_INDEX=
# You can set this number depending on the count of the validators you want to start. (Ex: if you want to start 64 validators this will be 63)
ACC_END_INDEX=
DEPOSIT_AMOUNT=32000000000
FORK_VERSION=0x10000038
# Mnemonics generated for validator keys
VALIDATORS_MNEMONIC=""
# Mnemonics generated for withdrawal
WITHDRAWALS_MNEMONIC=""
# Relative/Absolute file path for the buff
DEPOSIT_DATAS_FILE_LOCATION=

DEPOSIT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x4242424242424242424242424242424242424242
# Public address of wallet which holds testETH
ETH1_FROM_ADDR=
# Private key of the wallet which holds testETH
ETH1_FROM_PRIV=
FORCE_DEPOSIT=true
# Keep it empty for now
ETH1_NETWORK=
```
Decide on how many deposits you would like to perform. Generally this would be (amount of testnet ether you possess)/32. Set the `ACC_START_INDEX` and `ACC_END_INDEX` in **secrets.env** accordingly.

#### Register validators
- Generate the deposit data by using the following command.
```
./build_deposits.sh
```
- Register validators by using the following command.
```
./exec_deposits.sh
```

After deposit the test ETHs for validator, you can generate the keystores using the following command.
```
eth2-val-tools keystores --source-mnemonic "$VALIDATORS_MNEMONIC" --insecure --source-min $ACC_START_INDEX --source-max $ACC_END_INDEX
```
This will create `assigned_data` directory which holds `keys` and `secrets` folder.
You should copy these two folders inside `[eth-docker folder path]/.eth/validator_keys` and run `ethd keys import` to import keys for ethd validator instance.
> TIP: In case you don't see any progress from the above command, try pressing Ctrl+C until you can get the following result
```
keys and secrets directories found, assuming keys generated by eth2-val-tools
Keystore files directly under .eth/validator keys will be imported in a second pass

WARNING - imported keys are immediately live. If these keys exist elsewhere,
you WILL get slashed. If it has been less than 15 minutes since you deleted them elsewhere,
you are at risk of getting slashed. Exercise caution

I understand these dire warnings and wish to proceed with key import (No/yes)
```

## Docker

Interstate provides maintained Docker images for the Interstate sidecar.<br>
Running the sidecar includes several steps. This is a high level overview, the steps are provided below:
1. Set the environment variables
  - Update the `cb-config.toml` file
  - Update the `.config` file
2. Run the interstate-sidecar, builder api extneder, constraints collector and commit-boost
  - Start the interstate-sidecar service

Let's see one by one

### Set the environment variables

#### 1) Update `cb-config.toml` file for commit-boost
Before running the sidecar service, we need to update this file with our own settings.

- Get the genesis time of beacon node by using the api follow
` beacon_url/eth/v1/beacon/genesis `
- Update `genesis_time_sec` in `cb-config.toml` file
You can keep the remaining config settings.

#### 2) Update `.config` file for interstate-sidecar
The `.config` file is the place where all the environment variables for the sidecar, extender and collector are placed.
```bash
# Prepopulated with the setup for eth-docker: https://github.com/interstate-labs/eth-docker. You will have to change this if you setup a different way.

# Beacon client API

# Execution client API

# Engine API

# Constraints collector API

# Slot time in seconds

# Listening port of constraints collector

```

### Run the interstate-sidecar, extender, collector and commit-boost

#### Start the interstate-sidecar and commit-boost services

We already prepared the docker-compose.yml file which can be used to start the sidecar.
Run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up
```
